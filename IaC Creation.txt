context: I'm coding with Terraform and I want you to provide me a code snippets as a response.  We will break down the whole process in logical steps, i.e. first we create VPC, next we add subnets, then EC2 etc., as a result we will have a complete code

Generate Terraform code snippet to initialize remote backend, that use S3 bucket named vsani-tf-state-03082023 and DynamoDB table tf-state-lock, AWS provider version should be locked to version 5.10, limit Terraform version, credentials should be picked up from AWS profile generative-ai, region should be provided as variable.
ChatGPT

Sure, let's start by defining your Terraform backend and provider, taking all your requirements into account:

hcl

terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0.0, < 2.0.0"  # replace with your desired Terraform version range

  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "vsani-tf-state-03082023"
    dynamodb_table = "tf-state-lock"
    encrypt = true
    region  = var.region
    profile = "generative-ai"
  }
}

variable "region" {
  description = "The region where AWS operations will take place. Examples are us-east-1, us-west-2, etc."
  type        = string
  default     = "us-east-1"  # replace with your default region
}

provider "aws" {
  version = "5.10"
  profile = "generative-ai"
  region  = var.region
}

This code will initialize a Terraform S3 backend for your state files, with state locking through DynamoDB. The AWS provider is also set up to pick up credentials from the generative-ai profile.

The region for your AWS operations is declared as a variable, so you can provide a different value when running terraform apply or terraform plan if needed.

Please replace the "required_version" and "default" field of "region" to match your specific needs.

In the next steps, we'll look into creating a VPC, adding subnets and setting up EC2 instances.

1. move profile to variable with default value generative-ai
2. add VPC
3. add private subnets, quantity of the subnets should be provided as variable CIDR block, i.e. if there is 1 CIDR block provided, then Terraform create 1 subnets, if there is 2 CIDR blocks provided, then Terraform create 2 subnets. Add 1 CIDR block as variable input in separate vars file.
4. add public subnets, using the same logic 
5. add routes and IGW for public subnet
6. add routes and NAT for private subway 
ChatGPT

Great! Let's continue with your requirements. For this example, I am assuming that you want to separate your main configuration from your variables, and you have a variables.tf file to store your variable definitions.

    Move profile to variable:

hcl

# variables.tf
variable "profile" {
  description = "AWS profile to use for operations"
  type        = string
  default     = "generative-ai"
}

hcl

# main.tf
provider "aws" {
  version = "5.10"
  region  = var.region
  profile = var.profile
}

    Add VPC:

hcl

resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  tags = {
    Name = "main-vpc"
  }
}

    & 4. Add private and public subnets:

hcl

# variables.tf
variable "private_subnets" {
  description = "List of CIDR blocks for private subnets"
  type        = list(string)
  default     = ["10.0.1.0/24"]
}

variable "public_subnets" {
  description = "List of CIDR blocks for public subnets"
  type        = list(string)
  default     = ["10.0.2.0/24"]
}

hcl

# main.tf
resource "aws_subnet" "private" {
  count                   = length(var.private_subnets)
  vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block              = var.private_subnets[count.index]
  map_public_ip_on_launch = false
  tags = {
    Name = "private-subnet-${count.index}"
  }
}

resource "aws_subnet" "public" {
  count                   = length(var.public_subnets)
  vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block              = var.public_subnets[count.index]
  map_public_ip_on_launch = true
  tags = {
    Name = "public-subnet-${count.index}"
  }
}

    Add routes and IGW for public subnet:

hcl

resource "aws_internet_gateway" "main" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
}

resource "aws_route_table" "public" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
}

resource "aws_route" "public_internet_access" {
  route_table_id         = aws_route_table.public.id
  destination_cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
  gateway_id             = aws_internet_gateway.main.id
}

resource "aws_route_table_association" "public" {
  count          = length(var.public_subnets)
  subnet_id      = aws_subnet.public.*.id[count.index]
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.public.id
}

    Add routes and NAT for private subnets:

hcl

resource "aws_eip" "nat" {
  vpc = true
}

resource "aws_nat_gateway" "main" {
  allocation_id = aws_eip.nat.id
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.public[0].id
}

resource "aws_route_table" "private" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
}

resource "aws_route" "private_internet_access" {
  route_table_id         = aws_route_table.private.id
  destination_cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
  nat_gateway_id         = aws_nat_gateway.main.id
}

resource "aws_route_table_association" "private" {
  count          = length(var.private_subnets)
  subnet_id      = aws_subnet.private.*.id[count.index]
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.private.id
}

The code now creates a VPC with both public and private subnets. Public subnets have an Internet Gateway (IGW) attached, which allows instances in these subnets to access the internet directly. Private subnets are configured with a NAT gateway, which allows instances in these subnets to access the internet, but does not allow inbound connections initiated from the internet.

Please replace the CIDR blocks and any other parameters to match your specific needs.

1. should we state profile here?

  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "vsani-tf-state-03082023"
    dynamodb_table = "tf-state-lock"
    encrypt = true
    region  = var.region
    profile = "generative-ai"
  }

2. move VPC CIDR block to variable and set default value

resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  tags = {
    Name = "main-vpc"
  }
}

3. to create subnets mandatory use for-each 
ChatGPT

    The profile setting in the backend "s3" block is not necessary because the AWS CLI will default to using the AWS_PROFILE environment variable. If you want to specify a different profile for Terraform to use when interacting with the S3 backend, then you would include it. In this case, you already have it in your AWS provider. So, no, it's not mandatory to state profile here.

    For moving the VPC CIDR block to a variable, we would have to update the variables.tf and main.tf files like this:

hcl

# variables.tf
variable "vpc_cidr" {
  description = "CIDR block for the VPC"
  type        = string
  default     = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

hcl

# main.tf
resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block = var.vpc_cidr
  tags = {
    Name = "main-vpc"
  }
}

    To create subnets using for_each instead of count, you can modify the subnet resources like this:

hcl

# main.tf
resource "aws_subnet" "private" {
  for_each                = { for idx, cidr in var.private_subnets : idx => cidr }
  vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block              = each.value
  map_public_ip_on_launch = false
  tags = {
    Name = "private-subnet-${each.key}"
  }
}

resource "aws_subnet" "public" {
  for_each                = { for idx, cidr in var.public_subnets : idx => cidr }
  vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block              = each.value
  map_public_ip_on_launch = true
  tags = {
    Name = "public-subnet-${each.key}"
  }
}

Note that for_each takes a map or a set of strings, while count takes a list or a number. The above approach will create a map with index and CIDR block pairs, and for_each will iterate over them. The each.key and each.value correspond to the index and CIDR block respectively.
User
var.private_subnets is a list of strings, like, ["10.0.1.0/24"], so why couldn't we do something like

# main.tf
resource "aws_subnet" "private" {
  for_each                = var.private_subnets
  vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block              = each.value
  map_public_ip_on_launch = false
  tags = {
    Name = "private-subnet-${each.key}"
  }
}

what is map_public_ip_on_launch? 
ChatGPT

You're correct, you can use for_each directly with a list of strings. However, when using for_each with a list, the each.key would be the CIDR block, not an index, which may not be ideal for naming (since CIDR blocks can't be used as part of a resource name). In such cases, using a map, where each CIDR block has an associated index, can be more practical.

Here's the adjusted snippet according to your suggestion:

hcl

resource "aws_subnet" "private" {
  for_each                = toset(var.private_subnets)
  vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block              = each.value
  map_public_ip_on_launch = false
  tags = {
    Name = "private-subnet-${replace(each.value, ".", "-")}"
  }
}

Here, we're using toset function to convert list to a set which is necessary for for_each. Also, please note that in the Name tag, we replace . with - to make the CIDR blocks valid for resource naming.

Regarding map_public_ip_on_launch, this attribute indicates whether instances that are launched in this subnet should be assigned a public IP address. When this is false, as it is for the private subnet, instances will not be accessible directly from the internet. They would require a NAT gateway (as in your configuration) to access the internet. Conversely, if this is set to true for a subnet (like in public subnets), instances can be directly reached from the internet (if their security groups allow it) and they can directly access the internet.

ok, now move all this code to module "network" and provide me complete code snippets distributed between different files, like, main.tf, vars.tf, providers.tf etc.
ChatGPT

Sure, you can break down the code into separate Terraform files for better organization. Let's consider you have the following structure:

css

.
└── network_module
    ├── main.tf
    ├── variables.tf
    └── providers.tf

The content of each file would be:

    main.tf - This will contain the resources that will be created.

hcl

module "network" {
  source = "../network_module"

  vpc_cidr = var.vpc_cidr
  private_subnets = var.private_subnets
  public_subnets = var.public_subnets
}

# Main VPC
resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block = var.vpc_cidr
  tags = {
    Name = "main-vpc"
  }
}

# Private Subnets
resource "aws_subnet" "private" {
  for_each                = toset(var.private_subnets)
  vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block              = each.value
  map_public_ip_on_launch = false
  tags = {
    Name = "private-subnet-${replace(each.value, ".", "-")}"
  }
}

# Public Subnets
resource "aws_subnet" "public" {
  for_each                = toset(var.public_subnets)
  vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block              = each.value
  map_public_ip_on_launch = true
  tags = {
    Name = "public-subnet-${replace(each.value, ".", "-")}"
  }
}

# Continue with your IGW, NAT gateway, and route tables here...

    variables.tf - This will declare the variables that you will use.

hcl

variable "vpc_cidr" {
  description = "CIDR block for the VPC"
  type        = string
  default     = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

variable "private_subnets" {
  description = "List of CIDR blocks for private subnets"
  type        = list(string)
  default     = ["10.0.1.0/24"]
}

variable "public_subnets" {
  description = "List of CIDR blocks for public subnets"
  type        = list(string)
  default     = ["10.0.2.0/24"]
}

variable "profile" {
  description = "AWS profile to use for operations"
  type        = string
  default     = "generative-ai"
}

variable "region" {
  description = "The region where AWS operations will take place. Examples are us-east-1, us-west-2, etc."
  type        = string
  default     = "us-east-1"  # replace with your default region
}

    providers.tf - This will declare your provider configurations and backend.

hcl

terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0.0, < 2.0.0"  # replace with your desired Terraform version range

  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "vsani-tf-state-03082023"
    dynamodb_table = "tf-state-lock"
    encrypt = true
    region  = var.region
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  version = "5.10"
  region  = var.region
  profile = var.profile
}

You can run terraform init and terraform apply in the directory containing these files to deploy the VPC and subnets to your AWS account. Adjust the variable values in variables.tf or provide them during terraform apply to customize your deployment.

For completeness, you'd need to add the IGW, NAT gateway, and route tables resources to the main.tf file in the module, similarly to how it was done in the previous responses.

network module should contain only vpc, subnets, routes, IGW, NAT, everything else should be in the root module, we will use it going forward

    main.tf
    variables.tf
    providers.tf

In your network module directory:

    main.tf
    variables.tf

The contents of the root module files will be:

This structure separates your network resources into a separate module and leaves the root module for other resources that you will add in future. The root module calls the network module with required inputs, and any resources created in the network module are available to the root module for further configuration.

in root:
add secret resource, AWS Secrets Manager
as a separate resource add secret value, value will be a content of file located in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub, this resource should only be triggered once on creation, to make this add triggers to ignore change of the value in this file 
ChatGPT

In your root module, you can add resources for AWS Secrets Manager like this:

main.tf (append to existing file):

hcl

# Create Secret
resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret" "ssh_secret" {
  name = "SSHSecret"
}

# Store Public Key in Secret
resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" "ssh_secret_version" {
  secret_id     = aws_secretsmanager_secret.ssh_secret.id
  secret_string = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub")

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [secret_string]
  }
}

Here's a breakdown of what the code is doing:

    The aws_secretsmanager_secret block creates a secret in AWS Secrets Manager.
    The aws_secretsmanager_secret_version block creates a secret version and sets the value of the secret to the content of the public SSH key file. It references the secret created in the previous block.
    The file("~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub") function reads the content of the SSH public key file.
    The lifecycle block with ignore_changes = [secret_string] ensures that Terraform does not update the secret if the content of the SSH public key file changes. This means that once the secret is created, its value will not be updated in AWS Secrets Manager, even if the file's content changes.

Make sure the AWS Secrets Manager permissions are correctly configured in your AWS profile to create and manage secrets. Also, ensure the file ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub is present and accessible by Terraform.
User
what arguments EC2 resource has? 
ChatGPT

AWS EC2 instances in Terraform can be defined using the aws_instance resource type. This resource type provides a large number of arguments that you can use to configure your instances.

Here are some of the common arguments that you might use:

    ami (Required): The AMI to use for the instance.

    instance_type (Required): The type of instance to start.

    key_name (Optional): The key name to use for the instance.

    vpc_security_group_ids (Optional): A list of security group IDs to associate with.

    subnet_id (Optional): The VPC Subnet ID to launch in.

    user_data (Optional): The user data to provide when launching the instance.

    iam_instance_profile (Optional): The IAM Instance Profile to launch the instance with.

    ebs_optimized (Optional): If true, the launched EC2 instance will be EBS-optimized.

    tags (Optional): A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

    availability_zone (Optional): The availability zone in which to launch the instance.

Here is an example of a very basic aws_instance resource:

hcl

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c94855ba95c574c8"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  key_name      = "my-key"

  tags = {
    Name = "example-instance"
  }
}

This is just a basic example, and real use cases usually involve more configuration. For the complete list of arguments, refer to the official Terraform AWS Provider documentation.

The contents of the root module files will be updated to call this module:

main.tf (append to existing file):

# Call the EC2 module for public instances
module "public_ec2" {
  source = "./ec2"

  public_ec2_count   = var.public_ec2_count

  default     = 1
}

  description = "AMI for the public EC2 instance"
  type        = string
  default     = "ami-0c94855ba95c574c8"  # Replace with Amazon Linux AMI in your region
}

variable "public_ec2_instance_type" {

  type        = string
  default     = null
}

variable "private_ec2_count" {
  description = "Number of EC2 instances to launch in the private subnet"
  type        = number
  default     = 1
}

variable "private_ec2_ami" {
  description = "AMI for the private EC2 instance"
  type        = string
  default     = "ami-0c94855ba95c574c8"  # Replace with Amazon Linux AMI in your region

}

variable "private_ec2_user_data" {
  description = "User data to provide when launching the private EC2 instance"
  type        = string
  default     = null
}

Now, your root module will call the EC2 module and pass in the required parameters, including subnet IDs from the network module and the key from the secret manager. The outputs of the EC2 module will contain details about the public and private EC2 instances.

Note: You'll need to replace the placeholder Amazon Linux AMI with the correct AMI ID in your region, and verify that all other parameters match your environment and requirements.
User
1. in root, combine public_ec2 and private_ec2, there is no need to call them separately
ChatGPT

Yes, we can combine public and private EC2 resource blocks into one module call, parameterizing the necessary variables. Here's how you can do it in the root module:

main.tf (append to existing file):

hcl

# Call the EC2 module for both public and private instances
module "ec2" {
  source = "./ec2"

  public_ec2_count     = var.public_ec2_count
  public_ec2_ami       = var.public_ec2_ami
  public_ec2_instance_type = var.public_ec2_instance_type
  public_ec2_user_data = var.public_ec2_user_data
  public_subnet_id     = module.network.public_subnets[0]

  private_ec2_count     = var.private_ec2_count
  private_ec2_ami       = var.private_ec2_ami
  private_ec2_instance_type = var.private_ec2_instance_type
  private_ec2_user_data = var.private_ec2_user_data
  private_subnet_id     = module.network.private_subnets[0]

  key_name = aws_secretsmanager_secret.ssh_secret.name
}

Here, we're making a single call to the ec2 module, passing in the variables for both public and private instances. The subnet IDs come from the network module and the SSH key comes from the aws_secretsmanager_secret resource. This module call will create both public and private EC2 instances as per the input variables.

Please note that the module must be prepared to receive and correctly use all these variables to create the instances in the respective public and private subnets. The code within the ec2 module will need to handle the differentiation between public and private instances. The code provided in my previous message does this with separate resource blocks for public and private instances.
User
next, where have you defined module.network.private_subnets[0] and module.network.public_subnets[0], what is this? there is no outputs in network module so far 
ChatGPT

I apologize for any confusion. module.network.private_subnets[0] and module.network.public_subnets[0] are intended to represent the subnet IDs output by the network module for the first private and public subnets, respectively. I made an assumption about the structure of your network module, and I realize now that this may not have been clearly communicated.

We need to add outputs to the network module to make these subnet IDs available to other modules. Here is how you can modify the network module to output the subnet IDs:

In your network module directory, add a new file called outputs.tf with the following content:

outputs.tf:

hcl

# Output the IDs of the private subnets
output "private_subnets" {
  description = "The IDs of the private subnets"
  value = [for s in aws_subnet.private : s.id]
}

# Output the IDs of the public subnets
output "public_subnets" {
  description = "The IDs of the public subnets"
  value = [for s in aws_subnet.public : s.id]
}

In this configuration, we're using Terraform's for expression to create a list of subnet IDs from the resources created in the network module. We're then outputting these lists so they can be accessed by other modules.

Please note that this assumes that your network module creates the subnet resources with the names aws_subnet.private and aws_subnet.public respectively. If you are using a different naming convention, you should adjust the for expressions accordingly.
User
EC2 should be put in one of the subnets randomly chosen, they should not be only in 1 and the same subnet 
ChatGPT

Understood. To accomplish that, you can use the random provider in Terraform to randomly select a subnet from the list of subnets provided by the network module.

First, you will need to add the random provider to your provider configurations:

providers.tf (append to existing file):

hcl

# Random Provider
provider "random" {
  version = "~> 3.1"
}

Then, in your EC2 module, you can use the random_integer resource to select a random subnet index:

ec2/main.tf (edit existing file):

hcl

# Random subnet selection for public EC2 instance
resource "random_integer" "public_subnet_index" {
  min = 0
  max = length(var.public_subnet_ids) - 1
}

# Random subnet selection for private EC2 instance
resource "random_integer" "private_subnet_index" {
  min = 0
  max = length(var.private_subnet_ids) - 1
}

# Public EC2 Instance
resource "aws_instance" "public" {
  count                       = var.public_ec2_count
  ami                         = var.public_ec2_ami
  instance_type               = var.public_ec2_instance_type
  subnet_id                   = var.public_subnet_ids[random_integer.public_subnet_index.result]
  vpc_security_group_ids      = [aws_security_group.sg.id]
  key_name                    = var.key_name
  user_data                   = var.public_ec2_user_data
  associate_public_ip_address = true
  tags = {
    Name = "public-ec2-instance-${count.index}"
  }
}

# Private EC2 Instance
resource "aws_instance" "private" {
  count             = var.private_ec2_count
  ami               = var.private_ec2_ami
  instance_type     = var.private_ec2_instance_type
  subnet_id         = var.private_subnet_ids[random_integer.private_subnet_index.result]
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.sg.id]
  key_name          = var.key_name
  user_data         = var.private_ec2_user_data
  tags = {
    Name = "private-ec2-instance-${count.index}"
  }
}

This updated module creates a random_integer resource for each of the public and private EC2 instances, which generates a random integer within the range of the list of subnet IDs. This random integer is then used as an index to select a subnet from the list of subnet IDs.

In the root module, you'll pass the entire list of subnet IDs from the network module to the ec2 module:

main.tf (edit existing file):

hcl

# Call the EC2 module for both public and private instances
module "ec2" {
  source = "./ec2"

  public_ec2_count     = var.public_ec2_count
  public_ec2_ami       = var.public_ec2_ami
  public_ec2_instance_type = var.public_ec2_instance_type
  public_ec2_user_data = var.public_ec2_user_data
  public_subnet_ids    = module.network.public_subnets

  private_ec2_count     = var.private_ec2_count
  private_ec2_ami       = var.private_ec2_ami
  private_ec2_instance_type = var.private_ec2_instance_type
  private_ec2_user_data = var.private_ec2_user_data
  private_subnet_ids    = module.network.private_subnets

  key_name = aws_secretsmanager_secret.ssh_secret.name
}

This will ensure that your EC2 instances are spread across your subnets randomly.
User
add security groups for EC2s:
in public subnets EC2 should allow SSH port from variable "my_ip", which will be provided on CLI during terraform plan/apply commands execution
in private subnets EC2 should allow only SSH port from SG of EC2 in public subnet
ChatGPT

First, you'll need to create the security groups in your network module. Here's how you can do it:

network/main.tf (append to existing file):

hcl

# Security Group for public subnets
resource "aws_security_group" "public_sg" {
  name        = "public_sg"
  description = "Security group for instances in public subnet"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.main.id

  ingress {
    description = "SSH from my IP"
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = [var.my_ip]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

# Security Group for private subnets
resource "aws_security_group" "private_sg" {
  name        = "private_sg"
  description = "Security group for instances in private subnet"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.main.id

  ingress {
    description = "SSH from public SG"
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    security_groups = [aws_security_group.public_sg.id]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

Then, you'll need to output the security group IDs from your network module:

network/outputs.tf (append to existing file):

hcl

# Output the ID of the public security group
output "public_sg_id" {
  description = "The ID of the security group for public subnet"
  value       = aws_security_group.public_sg.id
}

# Output the ID of the private security group
output "private_sg_id" {
  description = "The ID of the security group for private subnet"
  value       = aws_security_group.private_sg.id
}

In your EC2 module, you'll accept the security group IDs as variables:

ec2/variables.tf (append to existing file):

hcl

variable "public_sg_id" {
  description = "The ID of the security group for public subnet"
  type        = string
}

variable "private_sg_id" {
  description = "The ID of the security group for private subnet"
  type        = string
}

And then use those variables to assign the security groups to the EC2 instances:

ec2/main.tf (edit existing file):

hcl

# Public EC2 Instance
resource "aws_instance" "public" {
  # ...
  vpc_security_group_ids = [var.public_sg_id]
  # ...
}

# Private EC2 Instance
resource "aws_instance" "private" {
  # ...
  vpc_security_group_ids = [var.private_sg_id]
  # ...
}

And finally, in your root module, you'll pass the security group IDs from the network module to the EC2 module:

main.tf (edit existing file):

hcl

# Call the EC2 module for both public and private instances
module "ec2" {
  # ...
  public_sg_id  = module.network.public_sg_id
  private_sg_id = module.network.private_sg_id
  # ...
}

This configuration will create two security groups in your VPC: one for the instances in the public subnets and one for the instances in the private subnets. The public security group allows SSH access from your IP, while the private security group only allows SSH access from instances associated with the public security group.

Please remember to replace "my_ip" with the actual variable name you're using for your IP, and make sure to pass it during your terraform plan or terraform apply commands.
User
instead of this, create this SGs in ec2 module 
ChatGPT

Sure, here is how you can create the security groups directly in your ec2 module:

ec2/main.tf (append to existing file):

hcl

# Security Group for public subnets
resource "aws_security_group" "public_sg" {
  name        = "public_sg"
  description = "Security group for instances in public subnet"
  vpc_id      = var.vpc_id

  ingress {
    description = "SSH from my IP"
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = [var.my_ip]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

# Security Group for private subnets
resource "aws_security_group" "private_sg" {
  name        = "private_sg"
  description = "Security group for instances in private subnet"
  vpc_id      = var.vpc_id

  ingress {
    description = "SSH from public SG"
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    security_groups = [aws_security_group.public_sg.id]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

# Public EC2 Instance
resource "aws_instance" "public" {
  # ...
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.public_sg.id]
  # ...
}

# Private EC2 Instance
resource "aws_instance" "private" {
  # ...
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.private_sg.id]
  # ...
}

ec2/variables.tf (append to existing file):

hcl

variable "my_ip" {
  description = "My public IP address for SSH access"
  type        = string
}

variable "vpc_id" {
  description = "VPC ID where EC2 instances will be created"
  type        = string
}

In your root module, you'll pass the required variables to the ec2 module:

main.tf (edit existing file):

hcl

# Call the EC2 module for both public and private instances
module "ec2" {
  source = "./ec2"

  # ...

  vpc_id = module.network.vpc_id
  my_ip  = var.my_ip
}

variables.tf (append to existing file):

hcl

variable "my_ip" {
  description = "My public IP address for SSH access"
  type        = string
}

Now, the security groups are created in the ec2 module, and the public security group allows SSH access from your IP, while the private security group only allows SSH access from instances associated with the public security group. The security groups are then associated with the corresponding EC2 instances. The my_ip variable should be provided during your terraform plan or terraform apply command.
User
module.network.vpc_id is not defined
ChatGPT

Apologies for that oversight. In order to get the vpc_id, we need to output the VPC ID from the network module.

network/outputs.tf (append to existing file):

hcl

output "vpc_id" {
  description = "The ID of the VPC"
  value       = aws_vpc.main.id
}

Now, in the ec2 module, you can use the VPC ID output from the network module:

main.tf (edit existing file):

hcl

module "ec2" {
  source = "./ec2"
  
  # ...
  
  vpc_id = module.network.vpc_id
  my_ip  = var.my_ip
}

This will ensure that the security groups and instances you create in your ec2 module are created in the VPC you defined in your network module.
User
give me CIDRs for public and private subnets, I want 3 subnets in public and same in private, VPC CIDR is 10.0.0.0/16
ChatGPT

If you are working with a /16 CIDR block for the VPC, you have a significant amount of IP addresses to work with.

For a setup with three public and three private subnets, you could use the following CIDR blocks:

    Public Subnets:
        10.0.1.0/24
        10.0.2.0/24
        10.0.3.0/24

    Private Subnets:
        10.0.4.0/24
        10.0.5.0/24
        10.0.6.0/24

Each /24 subnet will give you up to 256 IP addresses (including the 5 AWS reserved addresses), which should be more than enough for most applications.

Please note that this is a simple example and may not be optimal for all use cases. For a production environment, you should carefully plan your IP address ranges based on the expected size and growth of your networks.
User
distribute all available IPs between this subnets 
ChatGPT

If you are dividing a /16 CIDR block evenly among 6 subnets (3 public and 3 private), each subnet would get a /18 block. This would provide each subnet with 16,382 usable IP addresses (the size of a /18 block is 16,384 but the first 4 and the last IP in each subnet are reserved by AWS).

Here are the CIDR blocks for each subnet:

    Public Subnets:
        10.0.0.0/18
        10.0.64.0/18
        10.0.128.0/18

    Private Subnets:
        10.0.192.0/18
        10.1.0.0/18
        10.1.64.0/18

This distribution will use up the entire 10.0.0.0/16 block and part of the 10.1.0.0/16 block. It is a good idea to map out your IP address ranges in advance to prevent overlapping and to accommodate for future growth.

Remember to update the public_subnets and private_subnets variables in your root vars.tf file with these CIDR blocks:

vars.tf:

hcl

variable "public_subnets" {
  description = "CIDR blocks for the public subnets"
  type        = list(string)
  default     = ["10.0.0.0/18", "10.0.64.0/18", "10.0.128.0/18"]
}

variable "private_subnets" {
  description = "CIDR blocks for the private subnets"
  type        = list(string)
  default     = ["10.0.192.0/18", "10.1.0.0/18", "10.1.64.0/18"]
}

vars public_ec2_ami and private should expect values of Ubuntu or Amazon
add data resource in ec2 module, that will search for latest AMI for Ubuntu or Amazon, based on variable value, then use it in EC2 resources 
ChatGPT

Sure, you can add a data resource in your ec2 module to search for the latest Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) of either Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu, based on the value of the variable provided.

Update your ec2 module as follows:

ec2/main.tf (append to existing file):

hcl

data "aws_ami" "public_ami" {
  most_recent = true

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = [var.public_ec2_ami == "Amazon" ? "amzn2-ami-hvm-*-x86_64-gp2" : "ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-*"]
  }

  filter {
    name   = "virtualization-type"
    values = ["hvm"]
  }

  owners = [var.public_ec2_ami == "Amazon" ? "amazon" : "099720109477"] # Amazon and Canonical (Ubuntu) owner IDs
}

data "aws_ami" "private_ami" {
  most_recent = true

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = [var.private_ec2_ami == "Amazon" ? "amzn2-ami-hvm-*-x86_64-gp2" : "ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-*"]
  }

  filter {
    name   = "virtualization-type"
    values = ["hvm"]
  }

  owners = [var.private_ec2_ami == "Amazon" ? "amazon" : "099720109477"] # Amazon and Canonical (Ubuntu) owner IDs
}

# Public EC2 Instance
resource "aws_instance" "public" {
  # ...

  ami           = data.aws_ami.public_ami.id

  # ...
}

# Private EC2 Instance
resource "aws_instance" "private" {
  # ...

  ami           = data.aws_ami.private_ami.id
  
  # ...
}

ec2/variables.tf (edit existing file):

hcl

variable "public_ec2_ami" {
  description = "AMI type for public EC2 instances. Accepts 'Amazon' or 'Ubuntu'"
  type        = string
  default     = "Amazon"
}

variable "private_ec2_ami" {
  description = "AMI type for private EC2 instances. Accepts 'Amazon' or 'Ubuntu'"
  type        = string
  default     = "Amazon"
}

This setup will use the public_ec2_ami and private_ec2_ami variables to determine the AMI for the public and private instances, respectively. If the variable value is "Amazon", it will use the latest Amazon Linux 2 AMI; if the value is "Ubuntu", it will use the latest Ubuntu 20.04 LTS AMI. These are the latest versions of Amazon Linux and Ubuntu LTS as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021.

Please note that the AMI IDs for Amazon Linux and Ubuntu can vary between regions. Always check the AMI IDs for your specific AWS region.
User
how to provide main.tfvars file for terraform init, plan and apply commands?
ChatGPT

Terraform looks for a file named terraform.tfvars or any file with the .auto.tfvars extension by default, and it automatically loads them to populate variables. If you've defined your variable definitions in a different file or you want to use a specific file, you can use the -var-file flag when running terraform init, terraform plan, and terraform apply.

Here is how you would run these commands with a custom variable file:

bash

terraform init

terraform plan -var-file="main.tfvars"

terraform apply -var-file="main.tfvars"

You'll want to replace "main.tfvars" with the path to your actual .tfvars file.

Please note that the terraform init command does not use variable files since it's primarily used to initialize your Terraform working directory and to download the necessary provider plugins.

If you have sensitive data, remember to secure your .tfvars files, as they can often contain sensitive data. It's often a good idea to add *.tfvars to your .gitignore file to prevent accidentally committing sensitive data into source control. Instead, consider using secured methods for handling secrets, such as using environment variables, or better yet, a secured secrets manager like AWS Secrets Manager, or Vault by HashiCorp.
User
give me AWS CLI command to list S3 bucket using profile "generative-ai"
ChatGPT

Sure, the AWS CLI command to list all S3 buckets using a specific profile is as follows:

bash

aws s3 ls --profile generative-ai

The --profile flag specifies which profile to use from your AWS configuration. If you have not already set up this profile on your machine, you can do so by using the aws configure command and then specifying the profile name:

bash

aws configure --profile generative-ai

You'll be prompted to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and default output format. After this is done, you can use the --profile generative-ai option with AWS CLI commands to use these settings.

Please be aware that the AWS CLI must be installed and correctly configured on your machine to use these commands. For more information, refer to the AWS CLI User Guide.

it looks like terraform doesn't use generative-ai profile, or what is the issue here? 
ChatGPT

Terraform's backend configuration doesn't support interpolation (which includes using variables). The backend is configured before any variables or providers are loaded.

So, when the backend is being initialized, it doesn't have the value of var.profile. Because of this, it can't authenticate against your AWS account. The S3 backend is using the default profile, which doesn't have the valid credentials, resulting in the "ExpiredToken" error.

To address this issue, you will have to manually specify the profile in the backend configuration, as in:

hcl

terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.5"

  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "vsani-tf-state-03082023"
    key            = "terraform.state"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "tf-state-lock"
    encrypt        = true
    profile        = "generative-ai"
  }
}

You can continue using var.profile in your AWS provider:

hcl

provider "aws" {
  region  = var.region
  profile = var.profile
}

Now when you run terraform init, it should initialize the backend using the "generative-ai" profile.
User
can we parametrize region and profile in backend configuration? 
ChatGPT

Unfortunately, as of the current Terraform version (up to 1.0.4, as of September 2021), it's not possible to parameterize the backend configuration with variables, even though it would be useful in many scenarios.

The Terraform backend configuration is loaded during the terraform init process, before anything else runs, so it doesn't have access to variables defined in your .tf files, environment variables, or passed in via the command line.

Because of this, the backend configuration block must contain static values. However, you can manage different backend configurations for different environments by maintaining separate configuration files or by using partial backend configuration.

If you maintain different configuration files, you can use a command like cp backend-dev.hcl backend.hcl before running terraform init.

If you use a partial backend configuration, you'd provide the remaining values during the terraform init in the command line. For instance:

hcl

terraform {
  backend "s3" {
  }
}

And then run:

bash

terraform init -backend-config="bucket=vsani-tf-state-03082023" \
-backend-config="dynamodb_table=tf-state-lock" \
-backend-config="region=us-east-1" \
-backend-config="encrypt=true" \
-backend-config="profile=generative-ai"

Both these methods have their pros and cons, and you should choose what's best suited to your specific workflow and use case.
User
give me an example how to provide var my_ip on CLI when running terraform plan command
ChatGPT

To provide a variable when running the terraform plan command, you can use the -var flag followed by variable_name=value. Here is an example with my_ip:

bash

terraform plan -var 'my_ip=192.168.1.1'

In the above example, replace 192.168.1.1 with your actual IP address.

If you want to combine this with the use of a variable file, you can do it like so:

bash

terraform plan -var-file="main.tfvars" -var 'my_ip=192.168.1.1'

In this case, terraform will load variables from main.tfvars file and will also set my_ip to 192.168.1.1. If my_ip is also defined in main.tfvars, the command line value will take precedence.

ChatGPT

The issue you're encountering is related to how you're trying to access the id attribute of the aws_subnet.private and aws_subnet.public resources in the aws_route_table_association resources. Since aws_subnet.private and aws_subnet.public are created using for_each, they're not list but a map, and their attributes cannot be accessed using an index but with a key.

However, Terraform provides a function values which returns the values in the map as a list. So, you can change the lines where the subnet_id is assigned in the aws_route_table_association resources to:

hcl

subnet_id      = values(aws_subnet.private)[count.index].id

and

hcl

subnet_id      = values(aws_subnet.public)[count.index].id

This should resolve the issue. Your code would look like this:

hcl

resource "aws_route_table_association" "private" {
  count          = length(var.private_subnets)
  subnet_id      = values(aws_subnet.private)[count.index].id
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.private.id
}

resource "aws_route_table_association" "public" {
  count          = length(var.public_subnets)
  subnet_id      = values(aws_subnet.public)[count.index].id
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.public.id
}

The values() function is useful in such scenarios when we want to convert the map values to a list.

ec2 outputs.tf:

# Output details of the public EC2 instances
output "public_instances_details" {
  value = aws_instance.public
}

# Output details of the private EC2 instances
output "private_instances_details" {
  value = aws_instance.private
}
 will it work if there would be 3 private EC2 and 5 public? 
ChatGPT

Yes, it should work as intended. In the output block, you're essentially asking Terraform to output the details of all resources created by the aws_instance.public and aws_instance.private resource blocks. This is not contingent on how many resources were created by these blocks.

The aws_instance.public and aws_instance.private blocks would be considered a list of resources, and each item in that list would represent an instance that was created. So, whether it's 1, 3, 5 or even 100 instances, Terraform would output the details of all of them.

However, note that the output will be in a list format, so each instance's details would be a separate item in the list. The details would include all the attributes of the instances, such as instance ID, AMI, instance type, subnet ID, etc.

To better view the output in a more readable format, you may want to select only a few attributes. Here's an example:

hcl

# Output details of the public EC2 instances
output "public_instances_details" {
  value = { 
    for instance in aws_instance.public : instance.id => {
      instance_type = instance.instance_type
      public_ip = instance.public_ip
      subnet_id = instance.subnet_id
    }
  }
}

# Output details of the private EC2 instances
output "private_instances_details" {
  value = { 
    for instance in aws_instance.private : instance.id => {
      instance_type = instance.instance_type
      private_ip = instance.private_ip
      subnet_id = instance.subnet_id
    }
  }
}

In this example, we're creating a map for each instance where the key is the instance ID, and the value is another map with the selected attributes (instance type, IP and subnet ID).
User
generate outputs file for root module, that will print out each EC2 is it private or public, it's public and private IP address
ChatGPT

Certainly, in your root module, you can create an outputs.tf file with the following content:

hcl

# Output details of the public EC2 instances
output "public_instances_details" {
  description = "Details of the public EC2 instances"
  value = { 
    for instance in module.ec2.public_instances : instance.id => {
      type       = "Public"
      public_ip  = instance.public_ip
      private_ip = instance.private_ip
      subnet_id  = instance.subnet_id
    }
  }
}

# Output details of the private EC2 instances
output "private_instances_details" {
  description = "Details of the private EC2 instances"
  value = { 
    for instance in module.ec2.private_instances : instance.id => {
      type       = "Private"
      public_ip  = instance.public_ip
      private_ip = instance.private_ip
      subnet_id  = instance.subnet_id
    }
  }
}

This code will output the details of the public and private EC2 instances. For each instance, it outputs whether it is public or private, its public IP (for public instances only), its private IP, and the ID of the subnet it belongs to.

Please note that you have to make sure that the outputs public_instances and private_instances are defined in your ec2 module like this:

hcl

# Output details of the public EC2 instances
output "public_instances" {
  description = "Details of the public EC2 instances"
  value       = aws_instance.public
}

# Output details of the private EC2 instances
output "private_instances" {
  description = "Details of the private EC2 instances"
  value       = aws_instance.private
}

This way, the ec2 module outputs the instances, and then the root module can use these outputs to print the desired details.

ChatGPT

The error message is suggesting that the SSH key pair referenced by 'SSHSecret' does not exist in your AWS account. In your root main.tf, you're creating a secret in AWS Secrets Manager, but this does not create an SSH key pair in the EC2 key pairs.

Here is what's happening:

    You're creating an AWS Secrets Manager secret with the name 'SSHSecret'.
    You're storing your public SSH key in this secret.
    You're trying to assign the name of the secret ('SSHSecret') to the EC2 instances as the key pair name.

However, EC2 instances don't use Secrets Manager for their keys. They use EC2 key pairs. So the error occurs because there's no EC2 key pair with the name 'SSHSecret'.

To fix this, you should manually create an EC2 key pair in the AWS console or via the AWS CLI with the same private key that corresponds to the public key you're storing in Secrets Manager. When you create the key pair, you'll provide a name, and this is the name you should use for the key_name argument in your EC2 instances.

For example, if you create a key pair in AWS and name it 'MyKeyPair', you would use this in your main.tf:

hcl

module "ec2" {
  source = "./modules/ec2"

  # other variables...

  key_name = "MyKeyPair"  # not the Secrets Manager secret name

  # other variables...
}

If you want to automate key pair creation with Terraform, please note that Terraform can create the key pair for you, but you will need to manually or programmatically save the private key to a secure location. Terraform cannot retrieve the private key for an existing key pair. It can only get the private key when it creates the key pair.
User
add EC2 key pair resource in ec2 module and use secret value for public key 
ChatGPT

The aws_key_pair resource can be used to create a new EC2 key pair. This key pair can then be assigned to the EC2 instances you are creating. You can pass the public key directly from the AWS Secret Manager.

Please ensure that the public key stored in AWS Secrets Manager is correctly formatted and does not contain any additional characters or white spaces.

Here's how you could add this to your main.tf file in the EC2 module:

This is assuming that you have the secret_id of the AWS Secrets Manager secret as a variable key_secret_id.

Also, please be aware that aws_key_pair resource can lead to issues if you manually delete the key pair directly in AWS as the resource will still exist in the Terraform state.

Finally, note that this process won't handle the private key. You must have the corresponding private key securely stored or be able to regenerate it from a secure source. The private key is necessary for any process that requires SSH access to the instances.

The error messages indicate that the CIDR blocks you are trying to assign to the subnets 10.1.0.0/18 and 10.1.64.0/18 are invalid. This is because these CIDR blocks are not within the CIDR block of the VPC (10.0.0.0/16).

In AWS, a VPC spans all the Availability Zones in the region. After creating a VPC, you can add one or more subnets in each Availability Zone. Each subnet must be associated with a route table, which controls the traffic to and from its instances. When you create a subnet, you specify the CIDR block for the subnet, which is a subset of the VPC CIDR block. Each subnet must be entirely within one Availability Zone and cannot span zones.

You have defined your VPC CIDR block as 10.0.0.0/16, which means the valid IP range for your subnets is from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255. But 10.1.0.0/18 and 10.1.64.0/18 are outside this range, hence AWS does not allow you to create these subnets.

To fix the issue, change your subnet CIDR blocks to be within the VPC's CIDR block.

For example:

hcl

public_subnets  = ["10.0.192.0/18", "10.0.224.0/19", "10.0.240.0/20"]

This way, all the CIDR blocks for the subnets fall within the range 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255, which is valid within the VPC's CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16.
User

public_subnets  = ["10.0.192.0/18", "10.1.0.0/18", "10.1.64.0/18"]

provide me CIDR blocks for public subnets, that will work 
ChatGPT

Based on your current VPC CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/16, you can use the following CIDR blocks for your public subnets:

hcl

public_subnets  = ["10.0.192.0/18", "10.0.224.0/19", "10.0.240.0/20"]

Here's a brief explanation of these CIDR blocks:

    10.0.192.0/18 covers the IP range 10.0.192.0 - 10.0.255.255.
    10.0.224.0/19 covers the IP range 10.0.224.0 - 10.0.255.255.
    10.0.240.0/20 covers the IP range 10.0.240.0 - 10.0.255.255.

As you can see, all of these are within the range of your VPC CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16, which covers 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.255.255.

add constrain: all possible IPs should be used 
ChatGPT

Considering your constraint that all possible IPs should be used, and given your current VPC CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/16, we can split the remaining IP range into three CIDR blocks.

Your private subnets are already consuming half of the available IPs (10.0.0.0/18, 10.0.64.0/18, 10.0.128.0/18), so the other half can be divided amongst the public subnets.

Here's how you could organize your CIDR blocks:

hcl

private_subnets = ["10.0.0.0/18", "10.0.64.0/18", "10.0.128.0/18"]
public_subnets  = ["10.0.192.0/18", "10.0.128.0/19", "10.0.160.0/19"]

In this configuration:

    10.0.192.0/18 provides 16384 addresses, covering 10.0.192.0 - 10.0.255.255.
    10.0.128.0/19 provides 8192 addresses, covering 10.0.128.0 - 10.0.159.255.
    10.0.160.0/19 provides 8192 addresses, covering 10.0.160.0 - 10.0.191.255.

This configuration ensures that all IP addresses within the 10.0.0.0/16 range are used and equally divided among the six subnets.

Apologies for the confusion. There's an overlap in the subnet ranges. For the VPC CIDR 10.0.0.0/16, we need to assign the subnets in a way they do not overlap and use the entire available range. Here's the corrected version:

hcl

vpc_cidr        = "10.0.0.0/16"
private_subnets = ["10.0.0.0/18", "10.0.64.0/18", "10.0.128.0/18"]
public_subnets  = ["10.0.192.0/18", "10.0.224.0/19", "10.0.240.0/20"]

In this configuration:

    10.0.192.0/18 provides 16384 addresses, covering 10.0.192.0 - 10.0.223.255.
    10.0.224.0/19 provides 8192 addresses, covering 10.0.224.0 - 10.0.239.255.
    10.0.240.0/20 provides 4096 addresses, covering 10.0.240.0 - 10.0.255.255.

This configuration ensures that all IP addresses within the 10.0.0.0/16 range are used and are divided amongst the six subnets without any conflicts.

I apologize for the confusion. I made an error in my calculations. The 10.0.128.0/18 private subnet has an IP range that extends from 10.0.128.0 to 10.0.191.255, overlapping with the public subnet 10.0.192.0/18.

To address this, we'll adjust the subnet ranges to ensure that they don't overlap:

hcl

vpc_cidr        = "10.0.0.0/16"
private_subnets = ["10.0.0.0/18", "10.0.64.0/18", "10.0.128.0/18"]
public_subnets  = ["10.0.192.0/18", "10.0.224.0/19", "10.0.240.0/20"]

Let's revise the subnetting like this:

hcl

vpc_cidr        = "10.0.0.0/16"
private_subnets = ["10.0.0.0/19", "10.0.32.0/19", "10.0.64.0/19"]
public_subnets  = ["10.0.96.0/19", "10.0.128.0/18", "10.0.192.0/18"]

Now each subnet has a unique range:

Private subnets:

    10.0.0.0/19 provides 8192 addresses, covering 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.31.255.
    10.0.32.0/19 provides 8192 addresses, covering 10.0.32.0 - 10.0.63.255.
    10.0.64.0/19 provides 8192 addresses, covering 10.0.64.0 - 10.0.95.255.

Public subnets:

    10.0.96.0/19 provides 8192 addresses, covering 10.0.96.0 - 10.0.127.255.
    10.0.128.0/18 provides 16384 addresses, covering 10.0.128.0 - 10.0.191.255.
    10.0.192.0/18 provides 16384 addresses, covering 10.0.192.0 - 10.0.255.255.

With this configuration, the IP addresses of the 10.0.0.0/16 range are fully utilized and each subnet gets a unique IP address range.

I'm sorry for the confusion. The error occurs because the proposed new subnets are conflicting with existing ones. In other words, the AWS VPC already has some subnets with the same CIDR blocks.

Considering the VPC CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16, we have 65536 IP addresses. You've already allocated 3 x 16384 = 49152 IPs for private subnets ["10.0.0.0/18", "10.0.64.0/18", "10.0.128.0/18"].

So, we have 65536 - 49152 = 16384 IPs remaining for the public subnets.

The remaining IP addresses range from 10.0.192.0 to 10.0.255.255, which can be represented as 10.0.192.0/18.

Hence, the only possible solution that uses all remaining IPs for public subnets is one large subnet:

hcl

public_subnets  = ["10.0.192.0/18"]

Unfortunately, splitting the remaining IPs into smaller subnets might conflict with existing subnet allocations or might not utilize all remaining IPs.

This approach assumes that no other subnets exist within the 10.0.0.0/16 VPC other than the ones you've mentioned. If there are others, we would need to adjust for those as well.

private_subnets = ["10.0.0.0/18", "10.0.64.0/19", "10.0.96.0/19"]

Let's calculate the remaining CIDR blocks for public subnets:

    "10.0.0.0/18" covers IP range from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.63.255.
    "10.0.64.0/19" covers IP range from 10.0.64.0 to 10.0.95.255.
    "10.0.96.0/19" covers IP range from 10.0.96.0 to 10.0.127.255.

So, the remaining IP addresses cover the range from 10.0.128.0 to 10.0.255.255, which equals to 32768 addresses, which can be represented as 2 CIDR blocks:

    "10.0.128.0/18" covers IP range from 10.0.128.0 to 10.0.191.255.
    "10.0.192.0/18" covers IP range from 10.0.192.0 to 10.0.255.255.

Thus, the solution would be:

public_subnets = ["10.0.128.0/18", "10.0.192.0/18"]

ChatGPT

Given a VPC CIDR of 10.0.0.0/16, we can split this into 6 smaller CIDR blocks, 3 for public subnets and 3 for private subnets, using the /19 CIDR prefix.

Each /19 subnet contains 8192 addresses. The /16 VPC has 65536 addresses in total. Hence, we can divide it into 8 subnets with a /19 prefix, each subnet containing 8192 addresses. We will use 3 for private and 3 for public, leaving two unused.

The possible blocks are:

    10.0.0.0/19
    10.0.32.0/19
    10.0.64.0/19
    10.0.96.0/19
    10.0.128.0/19
    10.0.160.0/19
    10.0.192.0/19
    10.0.224.0/19

We'll assign the first three to the private subnets and the next three to the public subnets:

private_subnets = ["10.0.0.0/19", "10.0.32.0/19", "10.0.64.0/19"]
public_subnets  = ["10.0.96.0/19", "10.0.128.0/19", "10.0.160.0/19"]

You would still have 2 remaining /19 subnets ("10.0.192.0/19", "10.0.224.0/19") within the /16 VPC for future usage if needed.

subnets here should be randomly distributed between AZs
ChatGPT

To distribute the subnets across multiple availability zones (AZs) in a region, you can use the aws_availability_zones data source. This data source provides the list of availability zones that can be used by the account.

Here's an updated example of your subnet definitions, with AZ assignment:

hcl

# Fetch the list of available AZs in the region
data "aws_availability_zones" "available" {}

# Private Subnets
resource "aws_subnet" "private" {
  for_each                = toset(var.private_subnets)
  vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block              = each.value
  availability_zone       = data.aws_availability_zones.available.names[remainder(each.key, length(data.aws_availability_zones.available.names))]
  map_public_ip_on_launch = false
  tags = {
    Name = "private-subnet-${replace(each.value, ".", "-")}"
  }
}

# Public Subnets
resource "aws_subnet" "public" {
  for_each                = toset(var.public_subnets)
  vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block              = each.value
  availability_zone       = data.aws_availability_zones.available.names[remainder(each.key + length(var.private_subnets), length(data.aws_availability_zones.available.names))]
  map_public_ip_on_launch = true
  tags = {
    Name = "public-subnet-${replace(each.value, ".", "-")}"
  }
}

In this code, the aws_availability_zones data source fetches the list of available AZs. The remainder function is used to cycle through the list of AZs and assign them to the subnets in a round-robin fashion.

The expression remainder(each.key + length(var.private_subnets), length(data.aws_availability_zones.available.names)) ensures that the public subnets are distributed in a different set of AZs from the private ones, given that there are enough AZs in the region. If there are not enough AZs, the private and public subnets may end up in the same AZs.

Note: While it's recommended to distribute resources across multiple AZs for high availability, there might be cost implications depending on data transfer and other services. Be sure to understand the cost model before finalizing your architecture.

why availability_zone = ... different for private and public? 
ChatGPT

In the example given, the private and public subnets are being distributed to different availability zones (AZs) as a part of a common high-availability strategy.

In general, it's good practice to spread your instances across multiple AZs to avoid a single point of failure. If there's an issue in one AZ, your applications can continue to run in another. By having your public and private subnets in separate AZs, you're enhancing the fault tolerance of your system.

However, the expressions for availability_zone are different for private and public subnets to provide a rotation between AZs. This approach tries to ensure that the private and public subnets are spread out across the available AZs, rather than stacking all of one type in the same AZ.

The expression remainder(each.key, length(data.aws_availability_zones.available.names)) is used for private subnets. For public subnets, remainder(each.key + length(var.private_subnets), length(data.aws_availability_zones.available.names)) is used. The addition of length(var.private_subnets) in the second formula is to offset the AZ selection for public subnets.

This offset is particularly useful when the number of AZs is less than the number of subnets. For example, in a region with 3 AZs, if you have 3 private subnets and 3 public subnets, without the offset, the private and public subnets would be created in the same AZs. With the offset, the public subnets are created in different AZs, spreading out the risk of AZ failure.

However, if there are enough AZs for all your subnets (i.e., more AZs than subnets), the offset is not necessary, and private and public subnets would both be evenly distributed among the available AZs. It's good practice to plan for the worst-case scenario, hence the different expressions for availability_zone in this example.
User
use the following approach
based on var.public_subnets and private, for each value in the list generate random number and it will be an index in list of AZ we're getting from data source 
ChatGPT

If you want to randomly assign an availability zone to each subnet, you can leverage the random_shuffle resource. Please note that this will assign a random AZ to each subnet each time Terraform runs unless you save your state. Here's an example of how you can modify the subnet resources:

hcl

# Fetch list of availability zones
data "aws_availability_zones" "available" {}

# Generate a random sequence for private subnets
resource "random_shuffle" "private_az" {
  input = data.aws_availability_zones.available.names
  result_count = length(var.private_subnets)
}

# Private Subnets
resource "aws_subnet" "private" {
  count                   = length(var.private_subnets)
  vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block              = var.private_subnets[count.index]
  availability_zone       = random_shuffle.private_az.result[count.index]
  map_public_ip_on_launch = false
  tags = {
    Name = "private-subnet-${replace(var.private_subnets[count.index], ".", "-")}"
  }
}

# Generate a random sequence for public subnets
resource "random_shuffle" "public_az" {
  input = data.aws_availability_zones.available.names
  result_count = length(var.public_subnets)
}

# Public Subnets
resource "aws_subnet" "public" {
  count                   = length(var.public_subnets)
  vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block              = var.public_subnets[count.index]
  availability_zone       = random_shuffle.public_az.result[count.index]
  map_public_ip_on_launch = true
  tags = {
    Name = "public-subnet-${replace(var.public_subnets[count.index], ".", "-")}"
  }
}

In this code, random_shuffle generates a random permutation of the availability zones for each type of subnet. The shuffled list of AZs is then used to assign an AZ to each subnet. This way, every time you run Terraform, the AZs for your subnets will be randomly chosen from the list of available AZs.

Please note that this approach should be used with caution in production. The random assignment of subnets to AZs means your infrastructure could change each time Terraform runs, which could potentially lead to unwanted behaviors. It might be better to either keep the assignment of subnets to AZs static or use Terraform's state (backend) feature to store the state of your infrastructure.
User
can you add triggers to ignore changes in random? 
ChatGPT

To ignore changes in random assignments, you can use the lifecycle block's ignore_changes argument in the aws_subnet resource definition. However, please be aware that the ignore_changes argument will not prevent changes in the assignment upon first creation.

Here's an example:

hcl

# Fetch list of availability zones
data "aws_availability_zones" "available" {}

# Generate a random sequence for private subnets
resource "random_shuffle" "private_az" {
  input = data.aws_availability_zones.available.names
  result_count = length(var.private_subnets)
}

# Private Subnets
resource "aws_subnet" "private" {
  count                   = length(var.private_subnets)
  vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block              = var.private_subnets[count.index]
  availability_zone       = random_shuffle.private_az.result[count.index]
  map_public_ip_on_launch = false
  tags = {
    Name = "private-subnet-${replace(var.private_subnets[count.index], ".", "-")}"
  }

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [availability_zone]
  }
}

# Generate a random sequence for public subnets
resource "random_shuffle" "public_az" {
  input = data.aws_availability_zones.available.names
  result_count = length(var.public_subnets)
}

# Public Subnets
resource "aws_subnet" "public" {
  count                   = length(var.public_subnets)
  vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block              = var.public_subnets[count.index]
  availability_zone       = random_shuffle.public_az.result[count.index]
  map_public_ip_on_launch = true
  tags = {
    Name = "public-subnet-${replace(var.public_subnets[count.index], ".", "-")}"
  }

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [availability_zone]
  }
}

The ignore_changes argument within the lifecycle block tells Terraform to ignore changes to the availability_zone attribute when planning updates to the resource. This means that, after the initial creation of the subnet, any subsequent changes in the randomly assigned availability zone will not trigger updates to the subnet. Note that this will not prevent changes to the availability zone when the subnet is first created.

ChatGPT

You're using a for_each expression for your aws_subnet resource, but trying to use count.index in the availability_zone argument. These two constructs are not compatible in Terraform.

You should switch to using each.key or each.value with a for_each expression.

However, since we are using the random_shuffle resource, we cannot use each.key or each.value directly, because there's no guaranteed order in a for_each loop, while random_shuffle generates an ordered list of results.

In this case, you should switch back to using count instead of for_each to keep a consistent order:

hcl

# Generate a random sequence for public subnets
resource "random_shuffle" "public_az" {
  input        = data.aws_availability_zones.available.names
  result_count = length(var.public_subnets)
}

# Public Subnets
resource "aws_subnet" "public" {
  count                   = length(var.public_subnets)
  vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block              = var.public_subnets[count.index]
  availability_zone       = random_shuffle.public_az.result[count.index]
  map_public_ip_on_launch = true
  tags = {
    Name = "public-subnet-${replace(var.public_subnets[count.index], ".", "-")}"
  }
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [availability_zone]
  }
}

Please note, switching to a count based loop from a for_each loop can cause issues if you have existing infrastructure managed by Terraform. Terraform will see these changes as a resource destruction and recreation, which can cause downtime. If you have existing infrastructure managed by this code, it's recommended to perform such changes during a maintenance window.

we need to use for each 
ChatGPT

In this case, you could make use of a local value to create a map which relates your subnet CIDRs to the shuffled availability zones.

Here is an example:

hcl

# Generate a random sequence for public subnets
resource "random_shuffle" "public_az" {
  input        = data.aws_availability_zones.available.names
  result_count = length(var.public_subnets)
}

# Create a local map of public subnets to AZs
locals {
  public_subnet_to_az = { for i, cidr in var.public_subnets : cidr => random_shuffle.public_az.result[i] }
}

# Public Subnets
resource "aws_subnet" "public" {
  for_each                = toset(var.public_subnets)
  vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block              = each.key
  availability_zone       = local.public_subnet_to_az[each.key]
  map_public_ip_on_launch = true
  tags = {
    Name = "public-subnet-${replace(each.key, ".", "-")}"
  }
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [availability_zone]
  }
}

This local value creates a map where the keys are your CIDR blocks, and the values are the corresponding randomly shuffled availability zones. Then in your aws_subnet resource, you can use this map to get the correct AZ for each CIDR block.

Please note that random_shuffle resource may cause changes in your infrastructure upon each plan/apply as it might change the availability zone for a subnet, which will cause recreation of the subnet. The lifecycle block with ignore_changes will help to prevent this, but there is still potential risk if the resource random_shuffle is tainting or recreated for some reason. It's recommended to avoid using such randomness in your infrastructure code.
